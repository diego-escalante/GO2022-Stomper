This repo houses the codebase for my 2022 Github Game Off game jam entry: Stomper. The theme of the jam was "cliche." The game was created during the month of November.

### Tools used:
* Godot as the game engine.
* Aesprite for graphics.
* [Chiptone](https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone) by SFB Games for sound effects.
* PO-20 and Audacity for music.

### How to view the project / run the game locally:
You'll have to clone the repo, and open up the `project.godot` file in Godot 3.5
