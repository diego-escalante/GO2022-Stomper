## [Play the game here!](https://diego-escalante.itch.io/stomper)
This game was made in the month of November for the 2022 GitHub Game Off jam. The theme of the jam was "cliché." It was made with Godot 3.5 using GDScript.

## Tools Used
* [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) as the game engine.
* [Aesprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) for graphics.
* [Chiptone](https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone) for sound effects.
* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and PO-20 for music.

## Setting Up the Project Locally
1. Make sure you have [Godot 3.5](https://godotengine.org/download/3.x) installed, as that is the version of the engine that was used for this game. No need to get the .NET version of Godot, as this project purely uses GDScript.
2. Clone this repo in your desired directory: `git clone https://github.com/diego-escalante/GO2022-Stomper.git`
3. Start up Godot. In the initial Project Manager window, click Import and choose the `project.godot` file at the root of your cloned repo.
4. Once the engine opens up the project, you can run the game by using the Play buttons on the top right.
